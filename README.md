# Aleomail (ZKMail)

## Overview
Aleomail (ZKMail) is a blockchain-based email service that leverages Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and cryptographic techniques to provide secure and private communication between users. Built on the Aleo blockchain, ZKMail ensures end-to-end encryption, sender/receiver anonymity, and immutable mail records while keeping email contents confidential.

## Features
- **Decentralized Email System** – No central authority, fully on-chain.
- **End-to-End Encryption** – Emails are encrypted using asymmetric cryptography.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** – Verifies transactions without exposing message content.
- **Secure Authentication** – Uses blockchain identities and Aleo wallet integration.
- **Spam & Phishing Protection** – Smart contract-based filtering and reputation scoring.
- **Decentralized Storage** – Encrypted content stored via IPFS/Arweave, metadata on-chain.
- **Real-Time Notifications** – Alerts for incoming messages.

## Tech Stack
- **Blockchain:** Aleo (Zero-Knowledge Proofs support)
- **Cryptography:** ZK-SNARKs, ECC, asymmetric encryption
- **Smart Contracts:** Aleo programming model
- **Storage:** IPFS/Pinata (off-chain), Aleo blockchain (on-chain metadata)
- **Frontend:** React/Next.js
- **Backend:** Aleo-based smart contract execution

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+ recommended)
- Aleo Wallet
- Aleo Development Environment


### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone [https://github.com/your-repo/zkmail.git](https://github.com/Minimask-lap/aleomail)
   cd aleomail
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Configure environment variables:
   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Edit `.env.sample` with the required blockchain and storage configurations.

4. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage
1. **Register an account** using Aleo wallet.
2. **Send a mail** by encrypting the content with the recipient’s public key.
3. **Receive mail** by decrypting messages using your private key.
4. **Verify email transactions** using ZK-SNARKs to ensure privacy.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Implement inbox filtering with smart contract-based reputation scoring.
- [ ] Enable multi-chain interoperability with Ethereum and Solana identities.
- [ ] Develop a mobile-friendly UI for better accessibility.
- [ ] Introduce a DAO-based governance model.
